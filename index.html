      <h1>Wikimedia timeline of recent events</h1>
      <p>The Wikimedia Foundation has recently suffered from lack of communication with the editing community, poor transparency, and sudden loss of staff members. Some of these issues center around the recent Wikimedia Discovery efforts, some seem to stem from senior leadership. Unrest and discontent has been visible both within the editing community and the Wikimedia Foundation itself.</p>
      <p>This timeline has been developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GorillaWarfare">Molly White (User:GorillaWarfare)</a>, and compiled and written with immense help from many other people. It was initially published on <time datetime="2016-02-22 02:05">22 February 2016 at 2:05UTC</time>, and will be updated as more events unfold or come to light. It was most recently updated at <time datetime="2016-02-23 00:10">00:10 on 23 February</time>. To suggest a change, <a href="mailto:gorillawarfarewikipedia@gmail.com">email me</a> or <a href="https://github.com/molly/discovery-timeline">submit a pull request</a> on Github.</p>

            <h2>Media Viewer and superprotect conflict</h2>
            <p>The Wikimedia Foundation roll out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Media_Viewer">Media Viewer</a>, a software feature intended to provide a "more immersive multimedia experience". Following a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Media_Viewer/June_2014_RfC&oldid=616205396">community decision</a>, a volunteer administrator disables the feature. He is reverted by a Wikimedia Foundation staff member, who <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2014-August/073767.html">threatens</a> to remove his administrator status. Soon after, the Wikimedia Foundation rolls out a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy#Superprotect">software change called "superprotect"</a> that can restrict anyone but WMF employees from changing a page. These events result in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Media_Viewer_RfC">arbitration case</a> on the English Wikipedia, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2014-08-13/News_and_notes">controversy on the German Wikipedia</a>. The superprotect feature is eventually removed from all wikis on November 5, 2015.</p>

            <p>Jan-Bart de Vreede, then the chair of the Wikimedia Board of Trustees, <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:LilaTretikov_(WMF)&oldid=9585319#Our_Future_and_the_role_of_the_Foundation">posts on Lila Tretikov's Meta talk page</a> that "we are at a crossroads....Other internet projects (not limiting ourselves to websites) are passing us by left and right...All of this is going to require change, change that might not be acceptable to some of you. I hope that all of you will  be a part of this next step in our evolution. But I understand that if you decide to take a wiki-break, that might be the way things have to be. Even so, you have to let the Foundation do its work and allow us all to take that next step when needed. I can only hope that your break is temporary, and that you will return when the time is right."</p>

She includes the comment, "Search and Discovery, a new team, seems to be extraordinarily well-staffed with a disproportionate number of engineers at the same time as other areas seem to be wanting for them. I don't see "fix search" in the <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Communications/State_of_the_Wikimedia_Foundation#2015_Call_to_Action">Call to Action</a> document; even if it fell into the heading "Improve technology and execution", this seems like an abnormally large concentration of the top WMF Engineering minds to be focusing on a topic that didn't even rate its own mention in the CtA. More explanation of why Search and Discovery has suddenly become such a major focus is required to assess whether this is appropriate resourcing."</p>

            <h2>Damon Sicore leaves</h2>
            <p>Damon Sicore, Vice President of Engineering, leaves the Wikimedia Foundation after eight months of employment. This is first brought to light when <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2015-June/078283.html">someone notices his account has been removed from the Foundation wiki and globally locked</a>. Some Wikimedia Foundation staff clarify that Sicore is on leave for two weeks, though they have been instructed not to share this information in writing. Lila Tretikov subsequently <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2015-July/078460.html">reveals</a> that Sicore will not be returning. Reasons for his departure are not provided; in an FAQ attached to her email, Lila states that "Damon's departure is a personnel issue, so we are not able to comment on it."</p>

He goes on to detail his concerns, including that the WMF is "'selling' the Knight Foundation a search engine," confusion over whether or not the project will involve building a search engine, and "serious lack of transparency." He warns "it maybe a bigger issue than simply refusing a grant."</p>

            <p>Lila Tretikov calls an all-staff meeting with herself and board representatives to discuss growing staff discontent at the Foundation's senior leadership and to provide an opportunity for open staff feedback. This meeting establishes that the board has provided Lila with a second chance and offered her their full support. Although the resulting airing of grievances is cathartic for some, many WMF employees are left frustrated by the lack of agenda and established outcomes from the meeting and are disheartened by the stream of frustrated and negative feedback. One staff member characterizes the two-hour meeting as "a combination of a guilt trip and a trial, with no set goals."</p>

We are working with Lila to put together a plan to address these issues. We are confident that she has the capability and the commitment needed for this challenging time, and we know that, at the present time, she is listening carefully to the Board, to you, and to the community. To that end, the Board remains unanimously committed in our support of Lila in her role and in her efforts to adapt her leadership and to address these issues. We ask everyone to move forward. We will continue working with the Executive Director and supporting her progress, and we rely on your help in this process and your personal commitment to the WMF and our shared vision."</p>

            <p>The Funds Dissemination Committee include in their recommendations a request that the Wikimedia Foundation "improve its own level of planning transparency and budget detail." They state that they are "appalled by the closed way that the WMF has undertaken both strategic and annual planning, and the WMF's approach to budget transparency (or lack thereof). This sets a poor example for the affiliate organisations in the movement, decreases the moral authority of the FDC and decreases the general level of trust within the movement." They recommend that the Wikimedia Foundation submit their annual plan for review in the second round of the process.</p>

            <h2>Staff engagement survey results announced internally to staff</h2>
            <p>The results of a staff engagement survey are announced internally. Although more than two dozen Wikimedia Foundation staff members supported releasing the survey results publicly, this has not happened. A staff member leaked the survey results to the <i>Signpost</i>, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2016-01-06/News_and_notes">provided a summary but did not publish the results in full</a>. Among the findings, gleaned from 93% of staff members, were high levels of pride in working at the Wikimedia Foundation and strong confidence in line managers. More concerning were responses to other questions regarding the Foundation's senior leadership:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Senior leadership at Wikimedia have communicated a vision that motivates me: 7% agree</li>
              <li>Senior leadership at Wikimedia keep people informed about what is happening: 7% agree</li>
              <li>I have confidence in senior leadership at Wikimedia: 10% agree</li>
              <li>Senior leadership effectively directs resources (funding, people and effort) towards the Foundation's goals: 10% agree</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This apparently extends to members of the executive team: according to the <i>Signpost</i>, only one C-level has confidence in senior leadership.</p>

            <p>Days after Arnnon Geshuri's appointment to the board, a community member <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2016-January/080820.html">notes in an email to <i>Wikimedia-l</i></a> that Geshuri was involved in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_Litigation">High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation</a>. Geshuri, then the director of staffing at Google, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/27/2753701/no-poach-scandal-unredacted-steve-jobs-eric-schmidt-paul-otellini">received a complaint</a> from Steve Jobs that a Google recruiter had attempted to poach an Apple employee. Geshuri responded to say that the recruiter "should not have [contacted the employee] and will be terminated within the hour," and that "we will be very careful to make sure this does not happen again." Litigation on the issue later ended in a settlement involving both Google and Apple, amounting to $415 million.</p>

            <h2>Jimmy Wales describes James Heilman's statements as "utter fucking bullshit"</h2>
            <p>In a reply on Jimmy Wales' own talk page, Wales writes, "[Questions asking why Heilman was removed from the board have] been answered clearly.  As a quick review - my vote to remove him was because of a pattern of behavior and actions that I viewed as violating the trust and values of the community.  One example emerged clearly after he was removed - he made a false claim about why he was removed, and I got a unanimous statement from every board member involved that it was false.  The community deserves better than that. James has made a lot of noise about why he was dismissed which is utter and complete bullshit.  He wrote a nice piece for the Signpost about transparency which implied that the board got rid of him for wanting more transparency.  Utter fucking bullshit."</p>

            <h2>Lila Tretikov posts "Some background on the KE grant" on her Meta talk page</h2>
            <p>In response to questions about the Knight Foundation grant, Lila Tretikov posts <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:LilaTretikov_(WMF)&oldid=15294045#Some_background_on_the_KE_grant">an explanation</a> on her Meta talk page. It opens with, "As some of you know, I have been making concerted efforts to engage deeper on-wikis and to provide more insights into my thought process. As a demonstration of this commitment, I would like to share my thoughts on the Knight Foundation grant which has been called out for clarification." She goes on to take responsibility for not discussing the grant with the community sooner, and says, "Quite honestly, I really wish I could start this discussion over in a more collaborative way, knowing what I know today." In a later section, she explains that she cannot share the full content of the Knight Foundation grant paperwork because of "donor privacy."

            <h2>Frances Hocutt replies to thread about employee intimidation</h2>
            <p>Frances Hocutt, a software developer for the Wikimedia Foundation, <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:LilaTretikov_(WMF)&oldid=15301530#Employee_communications">responds</a> to a thread containing concerns about employee intimidation at the Wikimedia Foundation. She says, "I have taken great care to speak with civility during these months of conflict, particularly when I have spoken in public. I have also expressed my concerns about the potential for retaliation to my manager and to HR. I have been repeatedly assured that <b>I</b> have nothing to worry about due to the care I take with my words, but the specific standards that are being used to define 'aggressive', 'unprofessional', and 'uncivil' are still unclear to me. I hear my colleagues' concerns and see some of them being censured for speaking in ways that I have found sharply critical but still fundamentally honest and civil, and I worry that someday I will be the one who is suddenly found to have stepped over lines which were previously invisible or unspoken. I fear that even making this reply with my volunteer account will be considered 'unprofessional': it is both critical and public, and no clarification has been given yet on the question of what constitutes 'professional' usage of our staff and volunteer accounts." Her edit summary is, "reply to Pine: I'm still afraid." There has been no response from Tretikov.</p>

            <p>On January 11, Lila Tretikov had sent <a
href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2016-January/080987.html">an

managing the recruiting process that resulted in Arnnon Geshuri's appointment.
On February 6, Ruslan Takayev sends <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2016-February/081677.html">an email</a> including, "Are we any closer to having public comments from the BoT on how the Arrnon debacle was able to occur? I am especially interested in how Boryana fits in with this. Given Boryana's shared history at Tesla with Arnnon, she would surely have known about Arnnon's past at Google, but it would appear this past was never mentioned in the presentation to the board by her. At best this could be seen as an attempt to secure "jobs for the boys"; at worst it can be seen as incompetence on the part of Boryana." There has been no response.</p>

            <p>Brion Vibber, Lead Software Architect for the Wikimedia Foundation, writes a comment on Moran and Tretikov's blog post: "I know that former VP of Engineering Damon Sicore secretly shopped around grandiose ideas about a free knowledge search engine, which eventually evolved into the reorg creating the Discovery team. From leaked documents, we know at least some of those grandiose plans went into the early drafts of the Knight Foundation grant request, which eventually became a smallish grant to support Wikipedia's search capabilities. What we don't know is to what degree Executive Director Lila Tretikov was supporting the secretive "compete with Google" plan without putting it into WMF's public plans. It seems this would all be a simple case of "yes, there was some talk and we decided against it", so why the secrecy and stonewalling?"</p>

He adds, "If any APG-receiving affiliate conducted itself in such a non transparent, dishonest manner and with lack of clear, timely communication with its community and stakeholders, it would get seriously reprimanded by the Foundation."</p>

            <h2>Lila Tretikov sends email to <i>Wikimedia-l</i></h2>
            <p>Lila Tretikov sends an email to <i>Wikimedia-l</i> titled <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2016-February/082145.html">Why we changed</a>. In this email, she states that, "After 15 years since the birth of Wikipedia, the WMF needs to rethink itself to ensure our editor work expands into the next decade.... The choice in front the WMF is that of our core identity.... We could either fully focus on building our content and educational programs. Or we can get great at technology as the force multiplier for our movement. I believe the the former belongs to our volunteers and affiliates and that the role of the WMF is in providing global support and coordination of this work. I believe in -- and the board hired me to -- focus on the latter. To transform our organization into a high-tech NGO, focused on the needs of our editors and readers and rapidly moving to update our aged technology to support those needs. To this end we have made many significant changes.... Many at the WMF and in our community believe that we should not be a high-tech organization. I believe we should." She includes in the email a list of accomplishments the Wikimedia Foundation has made. She ends the email by stating, "The world is not standing still. It will not wait for us to finish our internal battles and struggles. Time is our most precious commodity."</p>

            <h2>Staff members reply to Lila Tretikov's <i>Wikimedia-l</i> email</h2>
            <p>WMF Lead Software Architect Brion Vibber includes, "First, many staff members feel that the accomplishments you claim under "we" are not attributable to you. Complaints about lack of strategy and confusing management have come from all levels of the staff; the implication that people who failed to be promoted might be behind discontent seems not to hold water.... If your contention is that tech supports you as a silent majority, I have strong doubts that this is the case."</p>

            <p>Development Outreach Manager Anna Stillwell and Research Analyst Oliver Keyes, reply to state their agreement with Vibber.</p>

            <p>Former Vice President of Product and Strategy Erik M&ouml;ller argues that Tretikov's claim to have "in the past year... for the first time since 2007... finally stem the editor decline" is inaccurate, or at least premature. He also questions which "pet projects" Tretikov was referring to when she pointed to "shutting down pet projects" as a measure of her success in setting standards for staff.

            <p>Lead Platform Architect Tim Starling writes, "Nobody is saying that Wikipedia is a lovely and friendly place to work.... I agree with your broad strategic goals (educate, innovate, retain volunteers, secure funding), I just doubt your ability to implement them. Because an ED of a non-profit organisation needs to be able to lead, not just dictate. And an effective manager should make decisions rationally and collaboratively."</p>

            <p>Technical Operations Principal Engineer Faidon Liambotis writes, "This is a pretty infuriating email, full of inaccuracies, FUD and unnecessary platitudes. We're in need of answers and actions, not essays. After such a failed record as an ED, I would expect you to acknowledge that we have indeed changed, but for the worst. Then, learn from your mistakes and work on fixing them (possibly silently; I'd undrestand that).... What you did instead was to sent a community-wide email making it sound like this was a carefully executed plan and the only reason people are revolting is because they're either change-averse or bitter for not getting a promotion. This is downright insulting. Finally, with all of your references to "community", it also sounds to me like like you're trying to gain some support from our community and effectively stategically place the (almost unanimously) revolting staff at odds with our community, in the hopes that you can get supporters and salvage your position. This would be a pretty desperate and selfish move. I hope I'm wrong."</p>

            <p>Senior Technical Operations Engineer Giuseppe Lavagetto writes, "Now, one easy way to read this, the most obvious one, is that the attitude towards work of the WMF employees was somewhat not right or unprofessional, and that we were lazy and not goal-driven. I would find this inappropriate in an internal email, but you went to state that in public, and I have to admit I find this is deeply offending on a personal and professional level."</p>
